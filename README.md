This EFI is for  **_**PERSONAL**_**  use. Please do some research if you have any intentions of replacing your EFI with mine. 

I am not responsible for any loss, including but not limited to Kernel Panic, device fail to boot, storage damage, data loss, rig spontaneously combusting, AI takeover, and whatever else I can think of in the future.
